This plugin provides a simple way to add a widget showing recently visited pages to visitors. It acts as a breadcrumb style listing of pages visited by a single visitor.
The list is visitor specific and can not be viewed from the admin.

This provides a single widget with an optional title and amount (default 5). The widget will have to be styled from the theme style as it does not contain any styling itself.
