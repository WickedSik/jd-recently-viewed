This plugin provides a simple way to add a widget showing recently visited pages to visitors. 

=== Description ===

This plugin provides a simple way to add a widget showing recently visited pages to visitors. It acts as a breadcrumb style listing of pages visited by a single visitor.
The list is visitor specific and can not be viewed from the admin.

This provides a single widget with an optional title and amount (default 5). The widget will have to be styled from the theme style as it does not contain any styling itself.

=== Installation ===

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/jds-recently-viewed-pages` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Drag the newly available widget from the widget list into the wished location
